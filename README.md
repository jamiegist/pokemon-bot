Greetings and welcome! I made a simple Pokemon Generator that will give you one of the original 150 pokemon at random when you enter the command "!battle" in the Discord app. It's built with python and the link will be a simple enough installation. The source code is here, but I did not include the token, just a filler variable for obvious privacy reasons. Here's a preview of the app:
